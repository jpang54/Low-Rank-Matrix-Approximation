# Low-Rank-Matrix-Approximation

Low-rank approximation of matrices is useful for finding hidden relationships that might not be apparent from high-dimensional data. We will be approximating a partially observed (typically) large matrix using a product of low rank matrices. 

A real-world application of LORMA is movie recommendations, similar to that seen in Netflix. Using a smaller dataset called [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), we are given data about users and their movie preferences, and we recommend movies that the users have not seen and will like.
